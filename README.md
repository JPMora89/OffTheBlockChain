## Details about the application
A full-stack application allowing users to get up-to-date information on the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market-cap. Users are able to create and add coins to different watchlists to help keep track of price movements.

## Features

Users can register an account and gain the ability to track the latest and most pertinent details concerning the leading cryptocurrency coins available in the market. Each user can establish multiple watchlists tailored to specific coin selections, each serving distinct purposes. Additionally, our knowledge section equips users with valuable insights to make well-informed decisions as they embark on their journey in this domain. Furthermore, our latest news section ensures users stay completely up-to-date with the most recent developments in the cryptocurrency space.

## URL

https://offtheblockchain-o0xy.onrender.com/

## API's

The API's used in this app are the coingecko API to receive the most recent coin prices as well as coin news API which retrieves the latest coins news.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

There are tests for all the components, just launch with "npm test"

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
